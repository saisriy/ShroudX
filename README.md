# 🕵️‍♀️ Steganography Project

**Steganography** is the art of hiding information inside another medium — such as an image — so that the very existence of the hidden message remains secret.  
So, thata what we do in our project ShroudX.

## 💡 How It Works
Each pixel in an image contains RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values.  
By modifying the **least significant bits** of these color values, we can embed binary data without visibly changing the image.

## 🚀 Features
- Hide secret file inside other file. 
- Decode and extract hidden file from stego images  
- Simple and efficient LSB-based implementation
